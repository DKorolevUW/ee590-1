# Welcome to the EE590!

Modern embedded systems programming starts with the hardware and extends all the way to the cloud. The resulting myriad of programming languages, libraries, tools, data structures, and algorithms that seem difficult for any one programmer to master. In this course, we introduce the fundamentals of programming languages and software engineering common to all levels of embedded systems programming, giving students the conceptual tools they need to tackle any project.

Specifically, this course takes a detailed look at two programming languages, C++ and Javascript; teaches students how to use build tools, version control, and advanced editors; describes how to use and create software libraries; and ties everything together with a collaborative software engineering project.
